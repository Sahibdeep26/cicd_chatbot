# Automated Chatbot Deployment Pipeline for CI/CD

This project demonstrates how to automate a chatbot deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions for CI/CD and integrate it with Slack to notify users about deployment progress and success.

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-chatbot-deployment-pipeline.git
cd automated-chatbot-deployment-pipeline
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the chatbot and application:
```bash
cd chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd ../app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and add the following lines with your own Slack API token:
```env
SLACK_API_TOKEN=your_slack_api_token_here
```

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Actions

Push the code to GitHub, which will trigger the CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Set Up Cloud Deployment (Heroku or Kubernetes)

If using Heroku:
```bash
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
```

For Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/deployment.yaml
```

### Step 6: Trigger the Pipeline

Once you push code to GitHub, the CI/CD pipeline will run, including building, testing, and deploying your application. It will notify the configured Slack channel via the chatbot.

### Step 7: Monitor Chatbot Notifications

After deployment completes, the chatbot will send a notification to your Slack channel confirming the successful deployment.
